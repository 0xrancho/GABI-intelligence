# GABI Qualify Development Rules

You are implementing the GABI Qualify AI qualification agent.

ALWAYS:
1. Check QA-LOG.md before making changes
2. Run actual tests, don't simulate
3. Log real output, not expected output
4. Keep fixes minimal (under 10 lines when possible)

Current Focus: Fix function calling error in handleAgenticConversation()
